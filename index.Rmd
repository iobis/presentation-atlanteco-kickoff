## The OBIS data pipeline

![schema](images/schema.png)

---

## Data standards and formats

- Darwin Core Archives: EML metadata + Darwin Core tabular data files
- support for event based datasets
- support for generic measurements or facts linked to vocabularies (type, value and unit)

![schema](images/envdata.png){ width=70% }

--- 

## Quality control

- quality control at the provider and node level using community contributed tools and services (LifeWatch, EMODnet)
- internal quality control: https://github.com/iobis/obis-qc
- will be aligned with work of the TDWG Data Quality Interest Group
- no specific quality control for metagenomic data yet

## OBIS API

- documentation at https://api.obis.org
- features
  - occurrence data
    - including measurements and facts
    - including quality flags
    - filter on time, location, depth, taxonomy, and many more
  - dataset metadata
  - gridded occurrence layers (GeoJSON, vector tiles)
  - checklists
  - statistics

--- 

## R package

- provides a more friendly way to interact with the OBIS API
- available from https://github.com/iobis/robis as well as CRAN
